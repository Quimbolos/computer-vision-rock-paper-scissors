# Computer Vision RPS

> AiCore computer vision project - endgoal: create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

Create a new GitHub repo to upload the code and allow version control throught the project.

## Milestone 2: Create the computer vision system

Create a computer vision model through the service Teachable Machine with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nothing. Using Teachable Machine, image samples of the 4 different classes are recorded, and the model is trained. The more samples, the more accurate the model will be. Finally, the model is downloaded and added into the GitHub repo.
